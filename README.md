# slowVinted

slowVinted is an on-going Chrome Extension project that intends to block fast fashion items from Vinted search results.

## Why?

I love buying second hand. It's ecological, economical and key to developing a unique sense of style.

Second-hand markets such as Vinted, whilst excellent platforms, have become overrun with cheap, low-quality fast fashion brands that are not built to last. Vinted do not currently offer a negative search filter, so I spend a lot of time either scrolling through endless reams of plastic Shein junk, or have to specify my search to specific brands, thus potentially missing out on unusual brands, or rare finds.

I therefore wanted to create a solution that would allow for users to remove these brands from search results.

The project is also being used as a way to familiarize myself with the Chrome Extension framework, and to gain some practical experience putting my Javascript skills to good use.

## State of the Project

(16/06/25)

- Basic functionality of pop-up is working. The user is able to select the brand they wish to filter out from a hard-coded list via a checkbox in a pop-up menu that appears upon clicking on the extension.

--> The pop-up does not yet save any ticked boxes to the browser, so all boxes appear unticked when the pop-up is reopened. This saving of state will be the next feature to be implemented.

The project has not yet been released onto the Chrome Extension store. I wish to implement a few more basic features, such as a basic UI and options for the user to select which brands they wish to filter out.
