# slowVinted

slowVinted is an on-going Chrome Extension project that intends to block fast fashion items from Vinted search results.

## Why?

I love buying second hand. It's ecological, economical and key to developing a unique sense of style.

Second-hand markets such as Vinted, whilst excellent platforms, have become overrun with cheap, low-quality fast fashion brands that are not built to last. Vinted do not currently offer a negative search filter, so I spend a lot of time either scrolling through endless reams of plastic Shein junk, or have to specify my search to specific brands, thus potentially missing out on unusual brands, or rare finds.

I therefore wanted to create a solution that would allow for users to remove these brands from search results.

The project is also being used as a way to familiarize myself with the Chrome Extension framework, and to gain some practical experience putting my Javascript skills to good use.

## State of the Project

(13/06/25)

- Basic functionality is working: brands to be filtered out have been hard coded, the script then searches the Dom for any items for these brands, and hides these from view.

- The project has not yet been released onto the Chrome Extension store. I wish to implement a few more basic features, such as a basic UI and options for the user to select which brands they wish to filter out.
